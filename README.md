# Mobile Web Specialist Restaurant App - Part 1
---

This project is part of Udacity's Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree.


##### How to run

You'd need to setup a static file server in order to run this app

I will be using `serve` from `npm` to run mine. You can use any of your favorite.

- Open terminal
- Run `npm i serve -g` or `yarn global add serve` to install it on your system (You'll need NodeJS and npm/yarn to set this up)
- Navigate to the project's directory
- Run `serve -s --port 8000` (we need to give 8000 as port)
- Head over to `localhost:8000` in your browser

and that's it. You have the app running.
